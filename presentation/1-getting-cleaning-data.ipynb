creative minds in science and technology to develop lithography machines that are key to producing faster, cheaper, more energy-efficient microchips. We design, develop, integrate, market and service these advanced machines, which enable our customers – the world’s leading chipmakers – to reduce the size and increase the functionality of their microchips, which in turn leads to smaller, more powerful consumer electronics. Our headquarters are in Veldhoven, Netherlands, and we have 18 office locations around the United States including main offices in Chandler, Arizona, San Jose and San Diego, California, Wilton, Connecticut, and Hillsboro, Oregon.\\n\\nJob Mission\\n\\nWe are looking for software interns who have a passion for designing and coding software for a distributed control system.Join Cymer/ASML and you will be joining a team that operates in a fast-paced, uniquely innovative and challenging environment to create new-to-industry solutions with rapid productization to support an aggressive commercialization plan for the EUV technology within ASML.\\n\\nYou will work with software architects and control system engineers as you develop software in response to the software and controls requirement and design documents.

There is interaction between control loops running on quad core boards and platform software that runs on IBM Bladecenter. Data is stored on board in Postgres Databases and is shipped via the fab network to data servers in San Diego. And our graphical user interface developed using Qt serves a complex set of users – operators, engineers, scientists and customers. And we don’t forget safety, the control system has a Siemens PLC to ensure both human safety is ensured and machine damage is prevented.\\n\\nCome and join our journey and you will be challenged and rewarded as you work alongside a group of talented, passionate and fun-loving engineers.

We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.\\nTo learn more about Roku, our global footprint, and how we've grown, visit https://www.weareroku.com/factsheet.\\n#J-18808-Ljbffr\",\n",
