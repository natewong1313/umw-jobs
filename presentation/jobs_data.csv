The Roku Culture
Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor.

We’re independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

ASML US, including its affiliates and subsidiaries, bring together the most creative minds in science and technology to develop lithography machines that are key to producing faster, cheaper, more energy-efficient microchips. We design, develop, integrate, market and service these advanced machines, which enable our customers – the world’s leading chipmakers – to reduce the size and increase the functionality of their microchips, which in turn leads to smaller, more powerful consumer electronics. Our headquarters are in Veldhoven, Netherlands, and we have 18 office locations around the United States including main offices in Chandler, Arizona, San Jose and San Diego, California, Wilton, Connecticut, and Hillsboro, Oregon.

Job Mission

We are looking for software interns who have a passion for designing and coding software for a distributed control system.Join Cymer/ASML and you will be joining a team that operates in a fast-paced, uniquely innovative and challenging environment to create new-to-industry solutions with rapid productization to support an aggressive commercialization plan for the EUV technology within ASML.

You will work with software architects and control system engineers as you develop software in response to the software and controls requirement and design documents. You will get to participate in designing for excellence, keeping in mind all the –cities and –abilities like reusability, modularity, simplicity, maintainability, …You will get to use UML to capture your design, you will also get to lead projects of small to medium size where you can analyze complex issues, determine the best test methodologies, and contribute in all aspects of the software development, build, test and release cycle.

Your universe will not just be the software team in San Diego, or even the controls team in San Diego, it will be your colleagues in all the functional teams in San Diego and Veldhoven, and as we try to meet our resource and budget challenges you will also work with our partners near-site, off-site as well as offshore.

And you may ask, what does the control system software do?Well, the control loops involve data exchange at speeds up to 100 kHz while data collection for diagnostics purposes is done at up to 1Khz rate. There is interaction between control loops running on quad core boards and platform software that runs on IBM Bladecenter. Data is stored on board in Postgres Databases and is shipped via the fab network to data servers in San Diego. And our graphical user interface developed using Qt serves a complex set of users – operators, engineers, scientists and customers. And we don’t forget safety, the control system has a Siemens PLC to ensure both human safety is ensured and machine damage is prevented.

Come and join our journey and you will be challenged and rewarded as you work alongside a group of talented, passionate and fun-loving engineers. You can tell your friends –I work on semiconductor lithography machines that allow the printing offiner features for the next generation of chips that power the innovations in the worldtoday.

The Roku Culture
Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor.
